# Rainfall Prediction using Machine Learning
### Overview
**Live Web-App** https://musk12-rainfall-prediction-with-mlflow.hf.space/

This project focuses on predicting rainfall using machine learning techniques while implementing experiment tracking with MLflow and DagsHub. 
The goal is to build an accurate model that forecasts rainfall based on meteorological features.
