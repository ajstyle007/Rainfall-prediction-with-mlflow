# Rainfall Prediction using Machine Learning
### Overview

This project focuses on predicting rainfall using machine learning techniques while implementing experiment tracking with MLflow and DagsHub. 
The goal is to build an accurate model that forecasts rainfall based on meteorological features.

### Features

- Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature engineering, and scaling.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding patterns, correlations, and distributions.
- Model Training: Comparing multiple models such as Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing models for better performance.
- Experiment Tracking: Using MLflow and DagsHub to log metrics, parameters, and artifacts.
- Deployment: Deploying the trained model using Streamlit.
